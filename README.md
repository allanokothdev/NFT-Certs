## Problem Statement

Hello, my name is Kelly, a Web3 writer and communications strategist.
I am part of the team submitting for the NFT Certs Platform.

Two years ago, a Kenyan court sentenced quack doctor Mugo wa Wairimu for 11 years. Mugo was found guilty of running an unlicensed clinic. 

Mugo wa Wairimu was further charged for:
unlawfully operating an unregistered pharmacy
operating a medical lab without registration and licence
operating a medical clinic without a registration and licence
practising as an unregistered and unlicensed person

Mugo got away with these crimes for long, because no one could easily establish his academic or professional background.

The worst part? Innocent citizens suffered under Mugoâ€™s supposed medical care. Mugo never understood medical ethics, and he committed serious sexual abuses againts his patients. How many Kenyans are suffering under people like Mugo and his ilk?

With a few taps on the phone, people can access verified certificates from a blockchain network, acknowledging the genuinity of personnel and services they are getting.

Our project aims at mitigating such occurrences at the earliest convenience. Here is Allan, with an explanation of how the NFT Certification Platform works.
